Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:
Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().
Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]
Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]
Inputs: Array 

Output: Sorted Array

Using quicksort

Function sort(arr) {
	If (arr.length <= 1) {
		Return arr;
	}

	Let pivot = arr[0];

	Let left = [];
	Let right = [];

	For (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { arr[i] < pivot ? left.push(arr[i]) : right.push(arr[i]);}

	Return sort(left).concat(pivot,sort(right));
};

Text example:

[5,9,3,7,1,2,4]
Pivot = 5
Is 5 > 9? => 9 goes right
Is 5 > 3> => 3 goes left
Is 5 > 7  => 7 goes right
Is 5 > 1 => 1 goes left
Is 5 > 2 => 2 goes left
Is 5 > 4 => 4 goes left

[3,1,2,4] [5] [9,7]
[3,1,2,4]
Pivot = 3
Is 3 > 1? etc.
